Note: All Changes added by me are under the AGPLv3 with additional 
permissions similar to those granted by the MAkehuman team, but 
only for the 'Official Version' as supplied by me.

To be clear, if someone takes the AGPL version, and modifies it 
then it is no longer the 'Official Version' and, as such
the AGPL applies in full without additional permissions.

I may change or update the 'additional permissions' at any time at my disgression.
Until such time, only my supplied 'Official Version' shall not have the
additional restrictions of the AGPL so applied, as a singular additional permission.
